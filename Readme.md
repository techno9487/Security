# Security

This project was originally created to be used in connection with my [facebook messenger bot](https://github.com/techno9487/go-messenger) for my universities freshers week challenge. It allowed the raspberry pi's addon camera to be used as a motion detector and would send a still shot fo any "motion" back to the users device.
